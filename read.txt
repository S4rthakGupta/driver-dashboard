Firstly I created a folder named: 
"SarthakGupta_Assignment1"

then I opened it with VS code and did Ctrl + ` to open the Terminal.


then I ran few commands.
npm init -y 
-- this will create dependecies and a random package as well.

something like this
{
  "name": "first-node-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is my first node project for Assignement 1.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Sarthak Gupta",
  "license": "ISC"
}

then I ran few npm commands which are as follows:
npm install node
npm install express
npm install ejs
-- these lines will create packages in node modules folder.

then I ran this command below so that I don't have to ran the server again and again everything I make changes.
npm install nodemon

then I ran nodemon .\app.js

--then I created views folder

--Then I created layout.ejs first under views folder

--Then I created partials folder under views and inside that added header.ejs

--then I created a folder named pages and added pages in it such as g.ejs, g2.ejs, dashboard.ejs, login.ejs, home.ejs

--then created a folder named public and under that created a folder with named CSS and gave the link of that CSS sheet in layout.ejs

--updated layout.ejs and other pages as well to use bootstrap features in it.

-- I also added code validation's using vanilla JS in the code and the code is executable completely with no console errors as well.

-- Finally in the last, I adjusted the CSS according to the requirements and I had to override some CSS in my CSS external sheet which is under the views folder.
